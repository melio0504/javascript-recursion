# Exercise 6 - fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is modelled as follows:

- The first number is `0`.
- The second number is `1`.
- Every next number is the sum of the two numbers before it.

So the sequence begins:

First: `[0]`  
Second: `[0, 1]`  
Third: `[0, 1, 1]`  
Fourth: `[0, 1, 1, 2]`  
Fifth: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`  
Sixth: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]`  
...

The pattern continues depending on how many numbers are requested.
